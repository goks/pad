This is an etherpad service hosted by Riseup. Riseup provides secure online communication tools for people and groups working for liberatory social change.

WARNING: This "pad" is a collaborative document that can be edited by anyone who has the URL in realtime. If you use an obvious name for the pad, it could be guessed.

WARNING: This pad will be DELETED if 60 days go by with no edits. There is NO WAY to recover the pad after this happens, so be careful!

If you want a pad to be kept for up to one year (365 days) without edits, append the word "-keep" to the end of the pad name.

If you want a pad to be deleted after one day, append the word "-tmp" to the end of the pad name.

For example:
* https://goks.github.io/pad/1234-tmp => deleted after 1 day of inactivity
* https://goks.github.io/pad/1234 => deleted after 60 days of inactivity
* https://goks.github.io/pad/1234-keep => deleted after 365 days of inactivity

Abusive behavior is not allowed on this service. Please email me at gokulav2@gmail.com to report any problems.
